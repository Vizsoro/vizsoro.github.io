## Puzzle 1

What does this program print?
```go
package main

func main() {
    x := 42
    fmt.Printf("p: %T", x)
}
```
1. it has a compile error
2. it has a runtime error
3. `p: main.P`
4. it runs but print nothing

The fmt package is not imported.

## Puzzle 2

What does this program print?
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	x := 42
	fmt.Printf("p: %T, &p: %p", x, &x)
}
```
1. it has a compile error
2. it has a runtime error
3. `p: main.P, &p: <some hex code>`
4. `p: main.P, &p: 42`

`&p` returns the the memory address of `p` and the `%p` fmt verb prints the pointer value.

## Puzzle 3

What does this program print?
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	x := 42
	s1 := fmt.Sprintf("%p", x)
	s2 := fmt.Sprintf("%p", &x)
	fmt.Printf("%t", s1 == s2)
}
}
```
1. it has a compile error
2. it has a runtime error
3. true
4. false

Guessing the answer is "false" is pretty easy but it's not straightforward what is going on in the background.
The `%p` verb is used to format a pointer so `s2` will be the pointer value (memory address) of `&x`. 
But what the hell is s1? I tell you, it is `%!p(int=42)`. Right now I can't really tell why. Maybe it says it is a pointer which point to the "int=42" value? I will need to dig deeper to really understand why this is the output.

## Puzzle 4

What does this program do?
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	x := 42
	fmt.Printf("%T %T", x, &x)
}

```
1. `42 42`
2. `int *int`
3. `42 <hex code>`
4. it doesn't print anything

The "%T" verb will format the Go-syntax representation of the type of the value and we have a type of an int (the "x") and a pointer to an int (the "&x")
