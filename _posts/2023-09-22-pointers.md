## Puzzle 1

What is the output of the following program?
```
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	j := 1
	increment(j)
	fmt.Printf("%d", j)
}

func increment(i int) {
	i = i + 1
}
```

1. "1"
2. "2"
3. There is a compile error.
4. There is a runtime error.

<summary>Explanation</summary>

In Go variable passed down to functions by value, which means the function will receive the copy of the original value. In this case variable `j` has the value of `4` so the `increment` function receives the copy of that and it can't change the value stored in `j`.

## Puzzle 2

Given the following piece:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	j := 1
	increment(j)
	fmt.Printf("%d", j)
}
```

How should the increment function look like so the program prints "2"?

1.
```go
func increment(i int) {
	i = i + 1
}
```

2.
```go
func increment(i *int) {
	*i = *i + 1
}
```

3.
```go
func increment(i *int) {
	*i = &i + 1
}
```

4.
It's not possible.

As described above the `increment` function will receive the copy of the value `4` so it cannot change the value stored in `j`.

## Puzzle 3

Which program will print "2"?

A. 
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	j := 1
	increment(&j)
	fmt.Printf("%d", j)
}

func increment(i *int) {
	*i = *i + 1
}
```

B. 
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	j := 1
	increment(*j)
	fmt.Printf("%d", j)
}

func increment(i &int) {
	&i = &i + 1
}
```

C.
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	j := 1
	increment(&j)
	fmt.Printf("%d", j)
}

func increment(i *int) {
	&i = *i + 1
}
```

D.
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	j := 2
	increment(&j)
	fmt.Printf("%d", j)
}

func increment(i int) {
	i = i + 1
}
```

<summary>Solution</summary>
A

<details>
<summary>Explanation</summary>

Let's see what are these mythical symbols: `&` and `*`!
The `&` operator goes in front a variable and will return the memory address of the variable. The `*` operator goes in front a variable that holds a memory address and returns the value from that memory address (this is something called dereferencing).

In B, in line 5 we try to dereference a variable which doesn't hold a pointer address. Since in Go we have different types for pointer addresses, B won't compile. Also `&int` in line 11 will yield a compile error since there is no such type.

In C, in line 12 the `&i` will yield the memory address of variable `i` and you cannot assign value to that.

In D, in line 7 we try to pass a memory address with type `*int` in place of an `int` but these are two different type, so this program won't compile.

At last in A, we pass the pointer value `&j` to function which accepts a memory address of an integer (`*int`) and in the `increment` function the dereferenced value `*i` is incremented.
